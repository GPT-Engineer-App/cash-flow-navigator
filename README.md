Adjust for changes in current assets and liabilities:
Add Decrease in Accounts Receivable (Year 1 to Year 2).
Add Increase in Inventory (Year 1 to Year 2). (Note: Decrease is a cash inflow)
Add Increase in Accounts Payable (Year 1 to Year 2). (Note: Increase is a cash inflow)
Subtract any other non-cash expenses added back to Net Income.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities:
Calculate the difference between Sale of PPE (Year 2) and Purchase of PPE (Year 2). (Sale is a cash inflow, Purchase is a cash outflow)
Cash Flow from Financing Activities:
Add Issuance of Common Stock (Year 2).
Subtract Dividend Payments (Year 2).
Subtract Repayment of Long-Term Debt (Year 2).
Net Cash Flow:
Sum the Cash Flow from Operating Activities, Cash Flow from Investing Activities, and Cash Flow from Financing Activities.
